*"Software Engineering: Card Game
Objective: Create a card game like Higher/Lower.
Instructions:
Design a standard 52-card deck model, with an option to add Jokers.
Implement a shuffling mechanism and basic game rules.
Build a simple CLI for game play (bonus if you add a GUI!).
This is a great task to highlight your software engineering and problem-solving skills. If you’re creative with game features or UI, you’ll stand out!

This submission contains two versions of the game depending on the preference of the tester."*

The python version of the game is implemented using tkinter and is the more basic version of the two.
To run this, enter the Python_game folder use the yml file to duplicate the enviornment and then run the main.py file.

The web app version of the game is more interactive and has a couple extra features. 
To run this app simply open the Website_game folder and run the run_website.py file.
